Example project for small OpenGL programs written in Rust. The project consists of a library for asset-management and opengl-wrappers as well as multiple binaries.

|Sobel Cube

|Bruteforce Terrain

|===

Code has been ported from C++ to Rust from {voxel-rendering-repo}[this repository^] and extended using {opengl-from-scratch}[this article^].

== Installation

I recommend using {rustup}[rustup^] to setup the development environment for Rust. Follow the {rustup}[tutorial^] to setup your development environment including cargo, the package/build manager for Rust.

== Usage

NOTE: Documentation for the library will be added at a later stage, when the API is more stable

Once {rustup}[rustup^] has been installed, you can build the project using `cargo build` or `cargo build --release` for a release-build respectively.

NOTE: You might be required to install development libraries for any of the dependencies (SDL2, OpenGL)

You can execute the binaries directly from cargo using `cargo run --bin <binary-name>`.
If no binary name is supplied, the command fails and the list of possible binaries is printed to console.
